# 📊 Hair Transplant Clinic Data Analysis  

## 🔎 Project Overview  
This project analyzes anonymized clinical data from a **hair transplant clinic** to demonstrate **data science skills** in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, forecasting, and business insights generation**.  

The dataset contains information on patient demographics, surgery details, graft counts, follow-up progress (1–13 months), clinical outcomes, and media/testimonial data.  

The objective is to showcase **end-to-end data analysis workflow** using **Google Sheets (pivot tables, charts, formulas)** and communicate **actionable insights** that could support clinical decision-making and marketing strategies.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description  
Key features of the dataset include:  
- **Month** – surgery timeline  
- **QHT ID** – anonymized patient identifier  
- **Demographics:** Age, Language, Location, Branch  
- **Procedure Details:** Case Type, Grade, Grafts, Surgery Date, Latest Visit Date  
- **Outcomes:** Patient Result, Progress at 1–13 Months  
- **Media & Marketing:** Consent, Video Shoot, Testimonial Type, Editors  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity  
- Anonymized patient names into unique IDs (P001, P002, …) to maintain confidentiality  
- Standardized date formats (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for time-series analysis  
- Converted categorical outcomes (`Successful`, `Partial`, `Failed`) into numerical scale (1, 0.5, 0) for quantitative modeling  
- Handled missing values (`0` for numeric, `Unknown` for categorical)  

📌 *Skills Demonstrated:* **data wrangling, preprocessing, anonymization, data integrity**

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### 1️⃣ Patient Volume Analysis  
- **Pivot Table:** Surgeries by Month and Branch  
- **Insight:** Seasonal peaks in June–July, Branch A has the highest patient volume  

### 2️⃣ Case Type & Grafts  
- **Pivot Table:** Average grafts per Case Type  
- **Insight:** FUT cases typically involve higher graft counts than FUE  

### 3️⃣ Clinical Outcomes  
- **Pivot Table:** Success vs Non-success across branches  
- **Insight:** 85% overall success rate; Branch B shows slightly lower performance  

### 4️⃣ Patient Recovery Progress  
- **Pivot Table:** Average improvement across 1–13 months  
- **Insight:** Noticeable improvement after 3 months; recovery plateaus after 9 months  

### 5️⃣ Marketing & Media Insights  
- **Pivot Table:** Testimonial and video shoot approvals  
- **Insight:** 60% of patients consent to testimonials, providing valuable marketing opportunities  

📌 *Skills Demonstrated:* **EDA, pivot tables, trend analysis, data visualization**

## 📊 Advanced Analysis  

### 🔗 Correlation Analysis  
- **Grafts vs Patient Result:** Moderate positive correlation (more grafts → higher success rate)  
- **Age vs Recovery:** Slight negative correlation (younger patients recover faster)  

### 📈 Forecasting & Predictive Modeling  
- Applied **linear regression (LINEST)** to forecast surgery volume for upcoming months  
- Prediction: ~120 surgeries expected next quarter  

### ⚠️ Patient Risk Segmentation  
- Defined **risk factors**: Age > 45, Grade ≥ 4, Grafts > 3000  
- Created a **risk score metric** and segmented patients into “High Risk” vs “Normal”  
- Found ~15% of patients fall into high-risk category, requiring closer monitoring  

📌 *Skills Demonstrated:* **statistical analysis, regression, forecasting, risk modeling, feature engineering**
