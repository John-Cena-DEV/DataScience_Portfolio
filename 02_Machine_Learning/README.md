# ðŸ¤– Predictive Modeling (Hair Transplant Clinic)

This folder contains **ML projects built with patient data** to predict outcomes and optimize clinic workflows.

## Projects
1. **Treatment Outcome Prediction**
   - Dataset: Patient history + transplant results
   - Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
   - Goal: Predict likelihood of high graft survival rates.

2. **Patient No-Show Prediction**
   - Dataset: Appointment records
   - Models: XGBoost, Decision Trees
   - Goal: Reduce missed appointments by predicting no-shows.

3. **Cost Estimation Model**
   - Dataset: Past treatment cost data
   - Models: Linear Regression
   - Goal: Estimate treatment costs based on graft count and technique.
